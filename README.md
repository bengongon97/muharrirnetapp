# muharrirnetapp

This app is designed to convert the WordPress based website muharrir.net to an Android application.
It is completely a hobby project and not a part of a schoolwork or a job.
Mainly developed by two developers from SabancÄ± University.

We may not be able to guarantee that the bugs and crashes are fixed and the application is robust. These are likely to happen as
the application is still on progress.
